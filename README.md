# Movie Analysis and Recommendation System

In this project, we will clean and analyze movie datasets using Python, followed by the implementation of various recommendation systems.

## Project Files Description

This project contains two Python notebooks:

1. **[data_cleaning_Analysis.ipynb](data_cleaning_Analysis.ipynb):**  
   In this notebook, we clean the data, explore the datasets, and perform analysis and visualization to uncover insights.

2. **[prediction_models.ipynb](prediction_models.ipynb):**  
   This notebook focuses on building prediction models and creating recommendations. We will explore and compare five different recommendation techniques:
   * Similarity between users
   * Correlation-based filtering
   * Clustering using K-means
   * Collaborative filtering using KNN
   * Content-based filtering

## About the Datasets

In this project, two different versions of movie datasets were used and combined to maximize the amount of data available, as each dataset contained unique entries not found in the other. Each dataset consists of two dataframes: one for ratings and one for movies.

* **Ratings Datasets:** `rating1`, `rating2`
* **Movies Datasets:** `movie1`, `movie2`

The datasets were sourced from [Kaggle.com](link).

## What Are Recommendation Systems?

Recommendation systems are algorithms designed to suggest relevant items to users, such as movies, products, or content, based on various factors like user behavior, preferences, and past interactions. They play a critical role in personalizing the user experience and are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube.

## Why Use Recommendation Systems?

Recommendation systems are essential for enhancing user engagement by providing personalized content that matches the user's interests. They help in improving user satisfaction, increasing sales or content consumption, and efficiently filtering vast amounts of information to present the most relevant items to users.
